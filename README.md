## Overview
Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm receives many funding applications from startups every day. This project aims at analysing a [dataset](https://github.com/Karthi-k-a/Fintech_Module13_Challenge_Neural-Networks/blob/main/Resources/applicants_data.csv) containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years and creating a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. With the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, the features in the provided dataset are used to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. 

The following steps were performed in [venture_funding_with_deep_learning]() file to build the model-
- Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.
- Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.
- Optimize the neural network model.
